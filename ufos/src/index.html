            <div class="container">
                <h3>Motivation</h3>
                <p>The first (well) known UFO sighting was in 1947. While flying his small plane, Kenneth Arnold, saw a
                    group of nine high-speed objects near Mount Rainier in Washington. He estimated the speed of the
                    saucer-shaped objects as several thousand miles per hour. Since then, hundreds of thousands of
                    UFO sightings have been submitted as possible proof of extraterrestrial evidence, with a significant
                    increase in the past 20 years. As part of our course requirement for CS 7295, we wanted to
                    analyze and bring life to these reportings with effective visualizations for others to
                    formulate their own opinions.<br/><br/>

                <h3>The Data</h3>
                <p>
                    The data set is sourced from the National UFO Research Center. It contains over
                    80,000 reports of UFO sightings over the last century, and it was geo-located and time standardized
                    by Sigmond Axel. The data contains city (categorical), state (categorical), time (quantitative),
                    description, and duration (quantitative) of each sighting and gives detailed descriptions of each
                    sighting per the written sighting report. It is important to note for the data integrity that each
                    sighting was screened, annotated and either approved or denied by sole employee and Director of the
                    National UFO Reporting Center in Washington State, Peter Davenport.

                    changed year over year? What are common shapes or descriptions? We've created data visualizations using
                    D3 in order to better understand these questions.<br/><br/>

                <h3>Data Analysis</h3>
                <p>
                    It’s clear to see that there has been a massive increase in reported UFO Sightings in the United States
                    since 1910, and more so since 2001. California has had the most reported sightings, and Washington State,
                    Texas, New York, and Florida have about half of the number of sightings. The majority of sightings look to cluster
                    in cities or well populated areas. Population centers, particularly the northeast,
                    seem to contain the bulk of the reported sightings. However, the eastern half of the country overall
                    has a distribution of sightings that is more uniformly spread out than simply the population distribution.
                    There doesn’t seem to be a correlation between the number of sightings and the duration.
                    A plurality of sightings have been described in the shape/form of “light” year after year, and most
                    have a very short duration.

                <p>
                    Upon deciding to use the the National UFO Report Center's data set for our project, we conducted a
                    phone interview with Peter Davenport to help us better understand his website and data set.
                    The current iteration of the website was set up in 1995 and hosts approximately 145,000 alleged
                    sightings, with a noticeable uptick since the option to report a sighting via the internet became
                    available. Currently there is a weekly UFO update on Coast to Coast AM radio, and the website boasts
                    many details with images of suspected sightings. The interview informed
                    us when deciding which tasks were most important for us to satisfy in our visualization:

                <h3>Design Process</h3>
                <p>
                    Based on the tasks outlined above, we created sketches that we debated extensively before
                    incorporating the best features of those sketches into a final workflow to keep as a goal.
                    Ultimately we decided a choropleth map of the US with points displayed by their locations and
                    a slider bar for the year of the sightings would be effective. Adding a feature to be able to
                    zoom in on a localized area - be it a state or more specific - would be essential to sorting
                    through the abundance of data. We had 3 iterations of design sketches. Please see our milestones
                    in our <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/16oy4M_LlNojWGV5_KAeLAwWVVAQtiOmo">Google Drive</a>.

                <h3>Final Visualization</h3>
                <p>
                    We are pleased with the outcome of our visualization, even though we made some significant stylistic
                    and functionality changes from our initial idea. Our final visualization shows the data in many different
                    ways, all including interactivity to different degrees, which allows the user to decide which path
                    through the story they want to take. Our first visualization shows the number of reporting sightings
                    over the history of our data set; this is the highest level of looking at the data that we encoded.
                    Our next visualization shows the reporting sightings per year and allows the user to zoom in and
                    brush the data that they are interested in seeing; there are two ways to brush down the data;
                    on the time series and on the chart itself. Our final visualization shows the geo-location of each
                    individual sighting during the selected year. The user selects the year using the slider above the
                    map, which populates using points in the exact geo-location. The choropleth map shows the number
                    of sightings, which links in color scheme to the graph to the right. In this graph, the points
                    indicate states, and the axes reflect the number of sightings versus average duration. The map
                    also has an on-click feature, which allows the user to drill down to a state level for more
                    discernibility with the data points and ease of access in reading and using the tool tip. The donut
                    plot shows the proportion of shapes sighted, either by year on a national level, using the brushed
                    data from the scatter plot, or the state data, depending on how the user chooses to interact.<br/><br/>

                    This visualization was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and several open-source projects
                    including <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3 v4</a>, <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3-queue">d3-queue</a>,

                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>
                    Through the data collection efforts by the NUFORC, which has made this data publicly available,
                    we have the tools to understand the areas of the country that are most likely to have UFO sightings
                    cumulatively and year over year, the most common UFO shape description, and how duration of the
                    sighting comes into the picture in order to help people formulate their own opinions. For future
                    enhancements, we'd like to associate historical weather data with the dates of the alleged UFO sightings.
                    Additionally, plotting sources of red flags such as to help identify locations of  airport, lighthouse,
                    and government research centers could help validate the sighting. The biggest challenge at the moment
                    is acquiring a suitable data set containing this information in a reasonable format.
