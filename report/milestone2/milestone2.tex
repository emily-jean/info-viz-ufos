\section*{1 Group Charter Reflection}

The team agrees that the division of tasks and work has been effectively and evenly distributed. We've been abiding by our agreed-upon guidelines and all feel comfortable with the group roles.\\

The interview conducted with Peter Davenport, the Director of the National UFO Reporting Center, who put together and validates the data set went extremely well. Although our first interactions with him were wavering and stern, Abby helped us conduct an extremely successful interview with her journalism background. During milestone one, we all agreed on visualizations and were able to come up with some new and creative visualizations to display the data for interesting insights and views.
